# Tortilla Soup

**Star**: true
**Description**: This might just be our favorite soup of all time. A one-pot dish, super quick to make, no frying, just a bit of boiling, and the flexibility of the dish is on par with fried rice! You could put pretty much anything into the soup, and you can also choose any BBQ sauce of your liking or make one yourself with just 4 ingredients. Also, it's freakishly delicious and addictive.

## Instructions

1. We add all the ingredients except the toppings and lime to a pot and bring to a boil. The toppings are the avocado, red onion, and tortilla chips. Remember to add the aquafaba with the beans into the pot.
2. While bringing the pot to a boil, we chop up the toppings.
3. We boil on medium-high heat for about 5 min. We taste the soup during this time, and add more of any ingredient we wish.
4. When it has finished boiling we add the lime, and we also bring some extra lime to the table for us to squeeze in as we desire.
5. We serve the toppings in bowls on the table for each person to freely take.

## Notes

This soup is slightly different each time we make it thanks to its versitility. Sometimes we also add plant-based melty cheese to it or plant-based sour cream with garlic.
