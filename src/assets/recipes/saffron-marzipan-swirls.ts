  instructions: [
    'Warm the milk to lukewarm temperature (not hot), and dissolve the yeast in it. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until frothy.',
    'In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and melted butter. Mix until a dough forms.',
    'Knead the dough on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.',
    'In a small bowl, prepare the filling by combining softened butter, cinnamon, and sugar until it forms a spreadable mixture.',
    'Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a rectangle about 1 cm thick. Spread the filling evenly over the dough.',
    'Starting from one long edge, roll the dough tightly into a log. Slice the log into 8–10 rolls and place them in a greased baking dish.',
    'Cover the rolls and let them rise for another 30–45 minutes, or until puffy.',
    'Preheat the oven to 250°C. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 8 minutes, or until golden brown.',
    'Let the rolls cool slightly before serving. Optionally, drizzle with vegan icing or enjoy as is!',
  ],
  notes:
    'For extra indulgence, top these rolls with a simple glaze made of powdered sugar and plant-based milk. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days, and reheat for a few seconds in the microwave for the best texture.',
