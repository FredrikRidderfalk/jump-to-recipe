  instructions: [
    'In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add the hot water while stirring with a spoon or chopsticks until a rough dough forms.',
    'Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.',
    'Divide the dough into four equal portions. Roll out one portion into a thin circle, about 8 inches in diameter.',
    'Sprinkle generously with sliced scallions. Roll the circle into a tight log, then coil the log into a spiral. Flatten the spiral gently with your palm, then roll it out again into a thin circle.',
    'Repeat the process with the remaining dough portions.',
    'Heat a skillet over medium heat and add a thin layer of neutral oil. Fry each pancake for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Add more oil as needed for each pancake.',
    'Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.',
  ],
  notes:
    'For an extra flaky texture, you can repeat the rolling and coiling process twice before frying. Serve with soy sauce, rice vinegar, or a mix of soy sauce, chili oil, and a touch of sugar for a delicious dipping sauce.',
