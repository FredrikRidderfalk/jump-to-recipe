  notes:
    'Chilaquiles are best served immediately after cooking to maintain the perfect texture balance between soft and crunchy chips. You can use store-bought salsa or make your own. This dish is traditionally eaten for breakfast or brunch and pairs well with refried beans, bolillo, and avocado slices.',
